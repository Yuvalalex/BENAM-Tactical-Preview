## Overview

BENAM is a single-repository application for field incident management. It covers the operational flow from setup and readiness, through active casualty handling and prioritization, to report generation and offline transfer.

From an engineering perspective, the value of this repository is not just the feature list. It shows how a state-heavy browser application can support offline operation, structured workflow handling, mobile packaging, regression coverage, and a gradual migration from legacy JavaScript to stricter TypeScript modules.

## Why This Repo Is Worth Reviewing

- Offline-first PWA with no backend dependency for core workflows
- Full Playwright E2E test suite covering major user flows and regression scenarios
- Hybrid legacy JavaScript plus modular TypeScript migration in a real working product
- Android packaging support through Capacitor
- RTL/Hebrew interface with touch-oriented field UX

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- Stateful single-page application design with a large UI surface area
- Offline persistence using IndexedDB, localStorage fallback, Service Worker, and PWA metadata
- Complex user workflows including triage, casualty detail handling, reporting, and QR-based sync/export flows
- UI support for RTL/Hebrew environments and touch-first interaction
- End-to-end verification with Playwright and CI automation
- Android delivery path via Capacitor and Gradle build tooling

## Audience

- Recruiters and technical evaluators reviewing product thinking and engineering execution
- Engineers assessing architecture, testing discipline, and maintainability in a hybrid codebase
- Reviewers looking at offline-first UX, delivery readiness, and end-to-end workflow coverage

## Core Product Flow

1. Lock Screen and app entry
2. Role and mission setup
3. Pre-mission preparation
4. WAR mode casualty operations
5. Report and evacuation outputs
6. Debrief and analytics screens

This flow is reflected directly in the application screens and test coverage.

## Core Capabilities

- Mission setup, readiness checks, and team context configuration
- Casualty tracking with triage, MARCH-oriented actions, vitals snapshots, and timeline history
- Evacuation support, prioritization, and structured report generation
- QR-based export/import and mesh-style sync workflows for constrained connectivity environments
- Touch-first RTL/Hebrew UX for field usage
- Local-only persistence with no required backend for baseline operation

## Architecture Snapshot

Hybrid codebase:
- Legacy runtime in [js](js)
- Newer modular code in [src](src)
- Browser shell in [index.html](index.html)
- Android packaging in [android](android)
- E2E coverage in [tests](tests)

Key repository signals:
- Large real-world UI runtime in [js/app.js](js/app.js)
- Incremental TypeScript architecture in [src](src)
- CI workflow in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Playwright regression coverage via [playwright.config.js](playwright.config.js)

## Migration Roadmap (Legacy → TypeScript)

- **Current source of truth**: `window.S` (legacy runtime), with TypeScript services reading through a bridge.
- **Already migrated to modular TS**: core DI/events/errors, domain services (`src/domain`), facades (`src/features`), background services (`src/background`), state/storage abstractions (`src/data`), and presentation infrastructure (`src/presentation`).
- **Still legacy-heavy**: large UI/event surface in `index.html` inline handlers and `js/app.js` operational flows.
- **In progress hardening**:
  - removed `eval` usage in `src` bridge/services;
  - introduced centralized delegated actions (`data-action`) for critical entry points;
  - aligned typed state repository with legacy storage keys for compatibility fallback;
  - tightened CSP by removing `unsafe-eval` while keeping legacy-compatible `unsafe-inline`.
- **Next migration target**: progressively replace remaining inline handlers and lift more mission flow logic from `js/app.js` into typed services/facades.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- A Chromium-based browser for local validation
- Optional: Android Studio and SDK for APK builds

cd BENAM---Tactical-Preview
npm install
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Optional legacy static server:

```bash
npm run dev:legacy
```

### Validate

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

### Build Android APK

```bash
./build_apk.sh
```

Release build:

```bash
./build_apk.sh release
```

## Testing And CI

The repository includes GitHub Actions CI for:
- TypeScript check
- Production build
- Playwright E2E tests

Main scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
